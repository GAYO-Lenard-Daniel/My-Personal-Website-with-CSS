    <p class="Start">In this page, I’ll introduce to you five underground folk artists that I think deserves your attention. I won’t cover all of the albums they have for the reasons you’ll find out as we go along. But even then, I encourage you to listen to the others as well.</p><br>

    <div class="Play"><div><h2 class="Name">1. Sibylle Baier</h2>
    <img src="./Sibylle Baier.jpg" class="Sibylle"></div>
    <div><p class="Main">Sibylle Baier is a German singer and actress who played in Wim Wenders’ 1973 film, Alice in the Cities. Her music was also featured in the German film Umarmungen und andere Sachen, but she eventually resigned herself from her acting and music career and opted 
        to move to America to raise her family. But around the early 70s, she recorded some songs of her own to tape which her son had discovered and compiled in a CD as a gift to family members for her 60th birthday. He also gave one to J. Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., and he passed 
        it down to</p>
    
</div>
</div>
<p class="Mainly2"> Orange Twin, a record label in Athens, Georgia, who eventually released it in 2006. Now, while it was technically released in 2006, it was technically recorded around the early 70s, so I’ll consider it (I just really wanted an excuse to talk about this record).</p>
    <p class="Mainly"> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1lf3rLmrO0ObMieg4YqEuB?si=DfSGOHqVR0GEtWVuEtB9gg">“Colour Green”</a> is one of the most stripped-back albums that I’ll be discussing in this list. But even with its more stripped-back nature, it arguably still holds up emotionally and lyrically. It’s as gentle as mother’s lullaby and has some great songwriting in it.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">We’ll start with the first track of the record as it encompasses all of the essential components that make this record so good. “Tonight” has an almost patched-like progression throughout its runtime. Some sections of the song are shortened at times after it’s repeated 
        or it adds something different to that section. It’s one of the many qualities of this album that helps the listeners to listen closer to these slight variations and details. Another defining feature of this album is the lyrical content which serves as vignettes detailing her 
        daily life and domesticity such as in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2JIVtls9Jf9nAosUbFzbyw?si=fe1541efe87d47d6">“Tonight”</a> where she dedicates this song to her partner and describes him when she comes home from work. Like when he butters his bread with the cat on his lap as he smiles at her. Or when he gives her the guitar and asks her to play a tune after 
        he accidentally broke the car. Or he stays by her side, understanding the heavy burden she carries, and listens to her crying all night. This isn’t an epic story brimming with grand and dramatic events. It’s a slice of life, giving us a window to a slice of a stranger’s daily life.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2ucFCqazVVhPKHDoaR73t8?si=4cca5b97d59b4b11">“I Lost Something in the Hills”</a> is a confessional song that tells us of her depression and grief over what had become of her and the yearning and nostalgia of her youth. She reflects upon her life, telling us that her life was all just a downward slope to mediocrity. The 
        guitar picking throughout this record is relatively simple and repetitive along with her dry and bleak vocals. Her vocals are so close that it almost sounds like she’s singing just beside you as the slight background static adds this nearly barren landscape to the music. It’s all very 
        melancholic music and one that’s very reserved sonically both vocally and instrumentally in this entire album.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1buRClsYPnS4HRRz4jRMmy?si=22bc22b7f2614f67">“The End”</a> is such a dreadful song, and I mean this lyrically. It describes the fallout of a very close friendship between Baier and her friend. That even after her friend tries to reconnect with her in a way, nothing ever works out either way. And it’s almost painful to 
        hear her just venting her emotions about it like how she cried trying to face the situation, trying to understand the reason how something so good between them could end so tragically, and how she laments the irreconcilable bond left over between them.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/00epdG9ONPL8KkErbmKW8o?si=0b0de8f30ddd4b62">“Forget About”</a> is such a tender ode to a person who made her feel comfortable and at peace with her past and her weaknesses. I can’t describe it, but the melody has this almost melancholic hopefulness that exudes so much joy and feels like slowly breaking away from your 
        past. This song is such a beautifully gentle palette cleanser after the heavier topics of the previous songs.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6vMhJgRB4jTrabGd5R0xwj?si=a5ea587090ec4a3c">“William”</a> is such a delightfully sweet song about a boy named William whose reputation was a “bad boy”. But as she got to know him more, he was just a troubled guy. She spends more time with him, driving around his car many cars and asking to have a green one too and having 
        a drink or two. She believed in his kindness and said that he was the sweetest boy she ever met. She starts to fall in love with him and even wants to have children with him. He eventually goes away for a while but would have a day or three with him when they meet again. It may sound 
        cliche on the ears, but hey, if that happened to you in real life, you wouldn’t be thinking that way. And the guitar is so much more playful and dynamic on this one in contrast to the majority of the other songs in this album too.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4n9CEd6rvubTtvmc4DUY5f?si=7080364aebf3445e">“Give Me a Smile”</a> is a menacingly harrowing song in the album, but also one of the most hopeful songs. It seems to be wanting this person to lend them their own happiness and gentleness for a moment while they have time with each other. Not requiring either of them to speak 
        of anything, even if it’s significant. All she wants is to bask in each other’s presence and hope that it will be enough to get by. And it’s accompanied by this gorgeous orchestration along with some of the best guitar playing on the album. This song really ended this album with a bang 
        and exceeded my expectations.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">Quite frankly, this entire record is beautiful and is filled with much intimacy through its excellent storytelling and its relatable themes of grief, nostalgia, and companionship. This is definitely something I would play right before winter hits the streets.</p><br>

    <div class="Pain"><div><h2 class="Name">2. Linda Perhacs</h2>
    <img src="./Linda Perhacs.jpg" class="Linda"></div>
    <p class="Main">Linda Perhacs is a dentist in Beverly Hills where celebrities often attend in. She met plenty of celebrities and one of them in particular was an Oscar-winning film composer, Leonard Rosenmann who composed for films such as Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Battle for the Planet 
        of the Apes, and the animated Lord of the Rings. He was a regular patient and was a favorite patient of hers. In one of his visits, he asked her about any hidden talents that she may have in which she told him that she had a passion for music, but chose dentistry for security. After his 
        next appointment,</p>
    </div>
    <p class="Mainly2"> she gives him a tape of hers that got her a deal with Universal to make a record. Unfortunately, though, she wasn’t able to tour her debut album because of her demanding occupation, which led to her debut becoming a commercial failure. While she eventually gained plenty 
        of acclaim years later and released two other excellent records as of now, I won’t be covering those albums in this review since this entire website is dedicated to music from the 60s - 70s so it wouldn’t make sense to include albums that were made a few decades after the stated scope of time.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">Her debut album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/53cxrg7kbFQxDizY0kcDQo?si=bDrPzW33Q1mLW4FQOLOS9A">“Parallelograms”</a> is such a transcendent listen. It really brings you to a whole other world through its spacey and psychedelic soundscapes. The harmonies on this album are absolutely stunning and almost meditative in a way due to its surmountable presence in the 
        songs and its lulling repetition. Some of the guitars layered on here sound almost rigid and the tone of it sounds almost like an electronic keyboard in a way, contributing to the enchanting beauty of the songs here. But the album can also sound really bluesy at times as well and the use of hand 
        drums gives it such a rhythmically rustic feel to the songs.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">The opener <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0PSxgms5q4pEtRGXRw2oWK?si=b75728e04fe547f7">“Chimacum Rain”</a> is a key example of the ethereal beauty found in this album and is a lovely introduction to the sound of this record. The vocal harmonies just cascade when they sing the song title and no amount of description will do justice to the actual sound of this song 
        or in any of this album, so you just have to listen to it yourself. And the eerie synths embellished in the mid-section of this song give it a sort of haunting and menacing feel to it as well. The lyrics of this track like many others are often cryptic and oblique, giving the songs a sense of mystery 
        and is rather a charming aspect of it. But this song portrays imagery of rain, stones, and nature in general.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2tBc2wnoYSNgpNLHzzNS0J?si=362515bd649b432a">“Call Of The River”</a> is simply ethereal. The tone of the second guitar sounds so mystical and other-worldly. And paired with the second voice assisting the main voice, it feels like you’re slowly levitating from your seat. It all just sounds pristine like calm seas in the evening. The cryptic 
        lyrics on this record also help elevate the track as well, especially in the chorus where she beckons someone to “come away” like a siren.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">The title track <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7vfih9HPftqMG5BK3ghsoz?si=915a50478b0e47a7">“Parallelograms”</a> is another enchanting piece of pure ascension, but is less accessible than “Chimacum Rain”. Mainly because of its atmospheric instrumental bridge. There is simply so many elements in this bridge that contribute to its mystical sonic landscape such as the quick, 
        yet fleeting pounding percussion that transitions to the bridge, the wintery chimes sprinkled throughout, the chaotic woodwind improvisation flying across and above, and the almost witchy chanting harmonies that eventually falls apart in an almost downward slope with the hissing and reverb effects applied 
        to it. Again, this is one of the songs that you have to listen to as my words cannot fully describe the song itself. The lyrical content here is, again, cryptic, but uses mathematical and scientific terminology instead of the nature themes in “Chimacum Rain”.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1EY7zEIE32twYy7zL05WG2?si=f1ae9f2f7a1740f1">“Hey, Who Really Cares”</a> has this weird clicky percussion with playful airy synths that become more present throughout the song’s runtime with simple guitar picking. But it contains some of the most relatable and personal tracks of the record as she asks someone to listen to her woes as no one 
        else was available to. It’s been weighing down on her for quite some time even to the point that her fondest thoughts had become suffocating for her.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1ULOCQ9oYMNt47o9b335Tv?si=cfd731fc143b4367">“Moons And Cattails”</a> is a unique fusion of both the blues with rustic percussion and psychedelic embellishment styles in the album. It also contains one of the best vocal performances in the whole album. Her vocals are almost hypnotic through her droning voice as she sings the choruses and then 
        she switches to her sublime higher delivery. The lyrics are still cryptic but portray a sinister atmosphere through odd imagery.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4oBWlIaxfS8jvkBb3I3Aiy?si=c54c6d81fb804ad1">“Morning Colors”</a> has some of the most poignant lyricism on this album. The brilliant imagery on this is so palpable and ornate that it can’t help but run through one's imagination to anyone fortunate enough to listen closely. And these were all the thoughts that ran through Linda’s mind for a man 
        who she deeply cares about and yearns for. She wonders if the beauty and comfort of their surroundings had passed by his mind before. The horn arrangements on this song are also brilliant and help lift the song’s serene nature instrumentally.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">Overall, this record will probably be the best alternative to getting high. It all just sounds so unreal, yet you’re hearing it in real life. It’s a gorgeous album and a promising listen filled with ethereal soundscapes and mystical lyricism that will shock you as to how you started floating.</p><br>

    <div class="Damnation"><div><h2 class="Name">3. Vashti Bunyan</h2>
    <img src="./Vashti Bunyan.webp" class="Vashti"></div>
    <p class="Main">Vashti Bunyan is an English singer-songwriter who became inspired to become a musician after discovering Bob Dylan. She was introduced to The Rolling Stones’ manager by her Mother’s actress friend which led her to be signed to Philipps Record. She released several singles before she even wrote her 
        debut such as “Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind” and “Train Song”. She then joined the singer-songwriter Donovan in his plan to travel to the Isle of Skye with other artists, musicians, and poets. She brought her dog and guitar with her, reconnected </p>
    </div>
    <p class="Mainly2">with her then partner, Robert Lewis, and brought him to 
        this commune as well. They even bought an old cabin and horse for the journey and travelled from South London to the Isle of Skye which was 650 miles away! After hearing Deroll Adams’ appraisal and encouragement to record her music, she returned to London in 1969 to record it a few months after they had settled 
        on a nearby island of Berneray. Fun fact, when they made it to the Isle of Skye, they found out that the musicians, artists, and poets that were supposed to get there had dissolved and so they had nowhere to live. Anyways, after her debut was released, it got good reviews but gained little attention. This 
        discouraged Bunyan immensely to the point that she gave up on her music career and even prompted her to never sing to her children. She eventually gained plenty of acclaim like with Linda Perhacs and even released two records after.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">Her debut album, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4KerqbIPBSPn5S2YTKwKys?si=DTGm9aXISU-9rlxjzB5nVg">“Just Another Diamond Day”</a>, is a pastoral listen. It sounds like you’re walking in a medieval forest with mystical creatures while you’re on a harrowing quest with your squad. It definitely sounds like Vashti Bunyan wrote this while riding on a wagon toward a foreign land.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">The opening title track, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6jaT3wEcPJSVkkGcEEp7s6?si=0769bcf741b44ff2">"Diamond Day"</a>, exemplifies this aesthetic beautifully. The finger-picked guitar is relatively simple, but the orchestral arrangements are what elevates this track supremely. The woodwinds follow the main melody of Bunyan’s vocalizing, which takes up the majority of the song, as the beds of 
        strings flutter and swell behind it. Besides her vocalizations, she just cites themes of nature and rural life. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1akOUwu4OW67NdeMfeOYlY?si=6a71d6068fcc4c1c">“Rainbow River”</a> is also another great example of this pastoral sound and lyrical content.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">The following track after the opener, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1Fnef4CPXOAWbWERg7f1Mz?si=6da98f9e21c84237">“Glow Worms”</a>, has this warm and comforting melody that I can’t help but be reminded of my mother’s embrace and the days I played in the fields. It evokes a sense of serenity, especially through the mystical lyrics sung in such a novice way that a mother sings to you in lullabies. 
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/03H34MCCAeh4kUgFxAhtJj?si=8655c26099c042fa">“Swallow Song”</a> has this waltz-like feel to it, especially with the swelling strings that flourish all throughout the track with more pastoral themes fleshed out lyrically.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/75qCx8WxOzlHpgpAw9n3Az?si=044b31c9f8d14c83">“Lily Pond”</a> literally transposes the melody from “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” with her chasing dragonfly with thousands of stars falling from the Milky Way to Mars with this plucked instrument and a form of glockenspiel as well. It’s a magical lullaby that I’ll sing to children before I sing them 
        “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” and make them think Vashti’s song was the original. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/51GceDJt5w3QPxXQCWv4pL?si=3d457d105b1843a8">“Where I Like To Stand”</a> sounds like a nursery rhyme with such whimsical fiddle playing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/70NvAzAG7m95PdTJt5q7D8?si=7653105968464618">“Come Wind Come Rain”</a> is another lullaby-like song with plucked instruments as accompaniment as she sings about traveling.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0O6NTpk8sGW7d7fN1NR46Y?si=030c479044fb43fb">“Timothy Grub”</a> has some gentle horn arrangements that sound like a group of tiny men playing the instruments as they ride through the bark carried by the river. There’s this fictional story of Timothy Grub and others that’s amusing and sounds like it came from Alice in Wonderland. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/43CgVh6H3YUf3OE6x8AKSx?si=d3cc0a23ed4545b4">“Rose Hip November”</a>
        has such a melancholic melody all throughout with a gentle organ filling up the space and a playful woodwind in the background. The instrumental expands near the end of the song for an impactful finish.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">I highly recommend this album when you’re just taking a stroll outside, or are staying in a rural area as it is most effective in such scenarios. For me, one of my goals in life is to buy a wagon and horse with my dog and my partner as we venture towards foreign, rural lands and tend to our crops 
        and animals with this album in the background.</p><br>

    <div class="Hades"><div><h2 class="Name">4. Judee Sill</h2>
    <img src="./Judee Sill.jpg" class="Judee"></div>
    <p class="Main">Judee Sill was an American singer-songwriter who was the first artist signed to Asylum Records, a record label that housed many legendary artists such as Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and Linda Ronstadt. She only played one song for David Geffen, the founder of Asylum Records, then told her to stop, and 
        said that she was in. She had dealt with many tragedies all throughout her life such as an abusive household, the death of many of her family members, several robberies in banks, prostitution, gaining addictions to several drugs, and several failed </p>
    </div>
    <p class="Mainly2">marriages. But she was musically gifted ever since she was a child 
        and her talents were further cultivated when she worked as the church organist in the reform school she had entered and was heavily influenced by Johann Sebastian Bach. She had sold one of her singles, “Lady-O”, to The Turtles to earn some money. Her debut album’s lead single, “Jesus Was A Cross Maker”, had some 
        modest radio play and received some critical praise as well. Though the album gained critical acclaim even back then, it made little impact commercially because of her reluctance to tour and her label’s negligence in the promotion of her debut. Still, this prompted Judee Sill to go bigger and bolder, and so in her 
        sophomore record, she wrote, arranged, and produced it solely with only some supporting production from Henry Lewy. Unfortunately, like her debut, her sophomore record received plenty of acclaim but failed commercially. This series of failure and disappointment had spiraled Judee to leaving her record label, 
        returning to her old drug habits, being in an abusive relationship which led to a terrible spinal injury, and solitude. Until she finally died from a drug overdose. I’ll only review her debut because her sophomore record leaned more toward Orchestral and piano rock than folk, though you should still listen to 
        that record since it’s also excellent.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">Judee Sill’s eponymous debut, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2zaIMRTlztlfkxLoo5nPtf?si=RhDC_5vKQ5WjuEsECeX86Q">"Judee Sill"</a>, is probably the oddest record out of this list, but one of the most harrowing musical odysseys ever made. It’s so bizarre, yet enchanting how she fuses a variety of different genres such as classical, country, and gospel in her take on folk music. It shouldn’t work, yet I 
        just end up having a religious experience by the end of it.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7iKnwGAMdY6LYLILGnsGhT?si=462a4a4658bd45f5">“Crayon Angels”</a> is probably one of the tamest songs in this album with just guitar and a woodwind, yet it still contains that magic found in her more bombastic tracks. The woodwind is playful and mystical which reminds me of Vashti Bunyan and the guitar is jaunty and dynamic. And her lyrics tend to be 
        cryptic like Linda Perhacs’, but her crypticism takes on more religious undertones with references to God, angels, and the afterlife. There really is no cohesive narrative here, but that’s what gives this song and the album as a whole its mysticism. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5lRJbMSRYkWh8BVTYGEuj1?si=f4707eb4839d4394">“The Lamb Ran Away with the Crown”</a> starts off as unassuming as 
        “Crayon Angels” with some nice, jaunty dynamics and a playful woodwind. But near the end of the song, it starts cascading with harmonies, other vocals, and more prominent woodwinds and horn arrangements, creating this lush wall of sound. Judee seems to be angry and constantly fights her own demons, but while this is 
        happening, The Lamb, Jesus, reigns sovereign. And in the end, we see her laugh and cry at the folly of her attempts to win on her own when the lamb had already won the fight.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3Y7Oo4J3dNET4FLMTXTFFA?si=d8fae234557241a0">“The Phantom Cowboy”</a> immediately gets to the genre-mashing goodness of the album and probably the more oddly arranged song in the record too. It starts on almost country in the first portion of the verses, then it starts to build tension with the fluttering strings and booming horns until it sounds like 
        something out of a Classical piece in the last part of the verses. She talks about this otherworldly cowboy who faces danger, traveling towards a star, and with Judee trying to call him down. It really is astonishing how incompatible all of these aspects are, yet she seamlessly weaves it so naturally. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0LZ9OtYtcZ8CPst3P0btXp?si=e54c9ec7bea048c7">“The Archetypal Man”</a> 
        leans into the country-classical cross-over more than “The Phantom Cowboy”, and it sounds sublime. The verse melody is so twangy and ear-catching and then the chorus just soars over the hemisphere. I love the pedal steel that just plays over this song, and it sounds so warm and rustic. I adore the beds of string that 
        flourishes in the chorus. It just takes the song to a different world than from the verse and it gives a sort of melancholic feel in the beginning until it sounds resolved near the end. Again, the lyrics are cryptic, but it seems to be describing a man that Judee met who seems to be in great pain, but endures as she 
        weaves in mystical and religious imagery. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3I6wdxs1GiKG7VX79HlITM?si=c32840e3237c4194">“Ridge Rider”</a> is another excellent fusion of country and classical influences in her folk music. The orchestration here is just absolutely breathtaking as the country influences make me want to swing with my imaginary partner inside a barn. She sings of this man as a brave and 
        humble man trying to get by the hardships of life and it’s admirable.</p>
    <p class="Mainly"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6aDzpmpdCkETGkCaa0LZuw?si=221f4532b2964c4f">“Lady-O”</a> is this beautiful folk song accompanied by strings. It’s relatively simple, but effective with its gorgeous arrangement as she sings about this woman that she’s love-struck by with these gorgeous imageries. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5qpWttDHZuzfoHuBIX5kRd?si=cb3990f36eb04b1f">“Lopin’ Along Thru the Cosmos”</a> is another track in line sonically with “Lady-O” as she sings 
        about these sacred imageries and how it seems that she’s been trying so hard that she seems to forget that however we are is fine.</p>
    <p class="Mainly">This album ends magnificently with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3UB4aYRgyGT50AFFyDoQHb?si=fc91f6e3e3234470">“Abracadabra”</a>. It’s probably the most extravagant composition on this album with its huge and driving climax towards the end. It’s the most cinematic track here and I’m glad that she ends this album with a bang. This album is just beautiful and one of the best pieces of music 
        that I’ve ever heard so far. I recommend anyone who appreciates masterful composition that harkens to those of Chopin or anyone who wishes to listen to something different.</p><br>

    <div class="Help"><div><h2 class="Name">5. Nick Drake</h2>
    <img src="./Nick Drake.jfif" class="Nick"></div>
    <p class="Main">Nick Drake was an English Singer-Songwriter who was signed to Island Records while still studying at the University of Cambridge. He caught the attention of Ashley Hutchings, the bassist for the Fairport Convention, during one of his performances and introduced him to a producer, Joe Boyd. Joe had listened to 
        one of his tapes and was impressed enough to reach out to him and asked him to make a record, to which Nick agreed. The recordings of his debut, “Five Leaves Left” at first were not successful due to Nick and Joe’s conflicting production decisions, the </p>
    </div>
    <p class="Mainly3">rushed and irregular availability of the backing musicians, and the 
        undesired arrangements of the current composer. He suggested bringing his friend from Cambridge, Robert Kirby, to do the arrangements instead. Joe was hesitant, but let him try out for once and Robert hit it off and arranged the majority of the orchestral backing in Nick’s debut album. The reception for the record was a 
        bit mixed at the time with poor marketing and its delayed release compounding the failure of the record commercially. He eventually dropped out of Cambridge and in the first few months after moving into London hopped from house to house to his friends to stay in. He then got to making his sophomore record, “Bryter Layter”, 
        with a more commercial or pop sound by adding bass and drums with some contributions from John Cale and a jazzier influence, yet it was still a commercial failure with mixed reviews like in his debut. This led Nick further into his depression and perform poorly in his concerts which also marked his last performance. It didn’t 
        stop him from making his final record, “Pink Moon”, though. He wanted this to be more in line with his desired arrangements, so he stripped all of the drums, bass, and orchestral arrangements found in his first two records, leaving him with only his vocals, guitar, and an overdubbed piano in only one of the tracks. That record 
        hough sold even less than his two previous records due to his unwillingness to promote it, but received fairly favorable acclaim. His life from then on just led him to more tragedies and further devastated his mental health. He was then found dead in his bedroom presumably due to an overdose of antidepressants.</p>
    <p class="Mainly5">Nick Drake’s debut, “Five Leaves Left”, is a remarkable, yet underappreciated record of its kind at the time of its release. This record is probably more in line with the contemporary folk of the likes of Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen both sonically and lyrically, especially Cohen. You can hear his influence throughout 
        this record: the dry and bleak baritone vocals, accompanied by gentle orchestrations, and a knack for a melancholic feel. Take for example one of the biggest highlights on this album and on his entire career, “River Man”. The chord progression here feels like an entire lifetime was infused in it, like all the pain, the sadness, the joy, and the resolution. The odd-time signature gives this such an interesting feel all throughout that’s 
        almost dizzying. And the string arrangements in here are one of the most beautiful ones I’ve heard in my entire life. It expounds on the melancholic feel to an almost cinematic degree. It feels like I’m living in the Great Depression where everything is black and white with everything falling apart. The lyrics portray an almost 
        mundane day that espouses existential dread about the things beyond our control. <br> “Day Is Done” is a more immediate track with more forward and present string arrangements that sound like the personification of dread itself. It’s as if so much effort has been put into something, yet they know in themselves that nothing will ever change it and that their demise is only right around the corner. And this 
        is an excellent example of when the music reflects the lyrics accurately as the description I gave was about the strings and not the lyrics, yet the lyrics reflect it as well.
    <br>“Fruit Tree” is another great track in line with the harrowing feeling of “Day Is Done”. But in context with Nick Drake’s history, this song is absolutely chilling. The reason is that the lyrics read as “no one will ever know or remember you from this time regardless of your works and that you’ll only find success right 
        after you pass away”. And that sounds almost like Nick just prophesied his entire life and career in this track.
    <br>“Time Has Told Me” is a gentle, folky opener accompanied by piano and slide guitar that seems to acknowledge his own talents and his acceptance of the likely failure his talents will lead him towards. “Three Hours” is a bluesy track with hand drums that’s reminiscent of Linda Perhacs. It has great dynamic switch-ups 
        throughout the song as it talks about a friend of Nick. “Man In A Shed” is a jaunty, jazzy track that’s in line with the folk of “Time Has Told Me” which Nick dedicates to a woman he seems to fancy who’s quite beyond his league financially.
    <br>His sophomore record, “Bryter Layter”, as I mentioned before, is a more pop effort by Nick Drake to gain more traction. And it definitely is a more commercialized version of it and it does succeed for the most part. Though I will admit that this is probably his weakest effort yet, it doesn’t mean that it’s bad by any means. 
        This is still a pretty good record.
    <br>You can hear it in tracks like “At the Chime of a City Clock”, “One of These Things First”, and “Poor Boy”. They all introduce drums and bass, poppier and conventional orchestration, and jazz influences with saxophones and bossa nova guitar. You also get a more stripped-back guitar with orchestrations like in his debut such 
        as “Hazey Jane I” and “Fly”, but you can hear that they’re aiming for more radio play.
    <br>“At the Chime of a City Clock” has such a dreadful description of the people’s grim life in this story. “One of These Things First” carries the previous song’s sentiment, lamenting his failure to reach his potential for his own, his friends, and his partner. “Poor Boy” reflects on this failure and the poverty he had to face 
        because of the failure of his debut. These three songs tie heavily on his career and its impact on his life.
    <br>Nick’s songwriting is still as top-notch as ever like in “Hazey Jane I” where he tries to put some sense into this woman who seems to be on a downward spiral in her life. The first verse is painfully inquisitive of Nick and the second verse just hits so hard, man. “Fly” seems like a lament on the direction of his music career 
        since the commercial failure of his debut and hopes that this time around will go differently.
    <br>Finally, his last album, “Pink Moon”, is more laid back similar to Sibylle Baier, but has more skilled and intricate guitar playing than Sibylle. Not to put Sibylle down or anything, but the guitar playing here is just more engaging and masterful. You really get to hear his skills shine with this completely laid-back approach. 
        And this sparseness also gives way to some of the most depressing songwriting ever made.
    <br>Let’s take the title track, “Pink Moon”. It’s just Nick strumming his guitar, but I find it to be some of the most intricate and masterful strumming I’ve ever heard done with a guitar at this point. It may sound simple at first, but as a guitar player myself, it showcases his splendid skills in the guitar. There’s something 
        about that piano part in the mid-section of this song. It’s relatively sparse and simple, but it is somehow so captivating and is almost like flickers of light in this barren soundscape. There’s an almost impending doom laced within the lyrics as he says that the pink moon will get us all. The following track, “Place To Be”, is also just 
        him strumming. But like the previous track, it’s all so played very well. There’s this melody that seems so indescribably familiar and bleak to me that can’t help but pull me in every time he describes his growing weakness and fragility.
    <br>“Road” has this interesting fingerpicking pattern along with its bizarre melody. And again, it’s all played so well with fascinating melodies all throughout. The lyrics seem to convey how this person is going towards a place of fortune and success as Nick prefers a path that leads him and will understand him in a way. “Which 
        Will” is also a similar track to the previous track, but with an ear-catching emphasis on the lower strings as he probes this person who the person chooses to love, him or someone else.
    <br>“Things Behind The Sun” is a sinister-sounding song with an ominous melody and chords that build tension. The lyrics reflect it quite well with him talking about fake people who associate with you, but are secretly unworthy of you and encourage you to keep on forward without caring what they think. “Parasite” has these 
        flickering legato notes from the higher string as he strums the guitar. Nick seems to be degrading himself by calling himself a parasite and paints a story of many people who seem to be as depressed as him.
    <br>“From The Morning” ends this record on a positive note and sounds like the most optimistic track in this album. I can’t help but be reminded by the opening track for some reason and it gives me the sense that Nick has found his peace, even if it does end badly. Nick just describes a beautiful day and night and it just sounds 
        wonderful. A beautiful way to end such a depressing record.
    <br>And this concludes my list! It’s very varied and diverse and should demonstrate the beauty of folk music in retrospect. I hope that this list will prompt you to listen to these records and that you will fall in love with one or more of these artists like I did, or at least like a song from here. My greatest joy lies in sharing 
        my passions with other people and it excites me so to find others caught in the same web of interests as I was.<br>
